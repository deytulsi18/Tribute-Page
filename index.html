            Sikh
            father and a
            Bengali mother. He began his music training at a very young age at home. His maternal aunt trained
            in Indian
            classical music, and his maternal grandmother used to sing. His maternal uncle played the tabla, and
            his mother also

            music" and his
            parents decided to train him professionally. He was taught Indian classical music by Rajendra Prasad
            Hazari and trained
            in tabla by Dhirendra Prasad Hazari. Birendra Prasad Hazari taught him Rabindra Sangeet (songs

        <h2>Early career</h2>
        <p class="para">Singh's musical career began when his guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari, who felt that "Indian
            classical
            music was a dying
            tradition", insisted him to leave his hometown and participate in the reality show Fame Gurukul
            (2005) at the age of
            18. He was eliminated by audience polling, finishing in sixth place.
        </p>
        <p class="para">During the show, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali recognized his talent and had him sing "Yun
            Shabnami" a song scheduled
            to be used in his upcoming film Saawariya. During production, the script changed and the song was no
            longer required. It
            was never released. After the Fame Gurukul, Kumar Taurani, the head of Tips, signed him for an album
            which was never released.

            freelance, staying in a rented room in the Lokhandwala area of the city. He invested the prize money
            of ₹10
            Lakh from 10 ke 10 Le Gaye Dil to build his recording studio. He became a music producer and
            began composing music
